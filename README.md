This time I added 3 new buttons:  the first one you will see is the green "+" button for adding a new flashcard; the second one is a cancel button if you wish to cancel adding a new flashcard; the last one is save button for saving the flashcard the user just adds. After you save the new fllashcard, then you will see the new card immediately.

## Lab 3

### App Description
This is very simple falshcard app. Now we have a funvtion to view multiple cards and a unstable deleteCard function.

### App Walk-though
After we add the second question, you can click the "next" and "last" buttons to go back and forth. If you keep clicking next, you will see your first card eventually. But if you keep clicking "last" button, you will stop at the first card. You can also delete the card you don't want. If you delete all the card, then you will be transfered to a new page saying you have deleted all the cards and next time you open the app, the default setting for the question and answer will be appeared.
